#### At first start a small base system is downloaded - desired packages can then be
#### installed using the apt package manager known from the Debian and Ubuntu Linux
#### distributions. Access the built-in help by long-pressing anywhere on the
#### terminal and selecting the Help menu option to learn more.

# Versions
